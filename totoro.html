            The movie My Neighbour Totoro is about two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move with their Dad, Tatsuo Kusakabe, 
 to a house in
            the countryside. Their new neighbour happens to be a spiritual tree guardian, Totoro.
            <br>
            <br>
            When the family arrive they see their new house for the first time. It looks very rundown and has a
            neglected feeling around it. But the sisters don’t mind at all, they think that it is the best thing in the
            world. Satsuki and Mei are super excited to explore the house. When they enter the kitchen they become aware
            that it is full of small fuzzy black things called dustbunnies (for more info see my characters page)
            <br>
            <br>
            One day while playing outside Mei spots a pair of white ears in the long grass. These ears belong to a small
            white Totoro. She follows the Totoro under the house and then in to the forest. Mei ends up at a massive
            tree in the middle of the forest. This tree is called a camphor tree; it is the home of the large Totoro.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mei tumbles down a hole at the base of the tree and ends up in Totoro’s den. She climbs on top of the big
            Totoro and falls asleep. When Satsuki gets home from school she asks her Dad where Mei is but he doesn’t
            know. Satsuki finds Mei’s hat at the edge of the forest, Satsuki goes a little way in to the forest and
            finds Mei asleep in a clearing. The Totoro is nowhere to be seen.
            <br>
            <br>
            One day Satsuki and Mei’s Dad had to work late. Satsuki and Mei have just walked home and it is pouring with
            rain. Their Dad has forgotten to take his umbrella with him to work. Satsuki and Mei decide to walk down to
            the bus stop with an umbrella to wait for him. While they are waiting the most peculiar thing happens, the
            big Totoro comes up and stands next to them. Satsuki is amazed, she also realises the Totoro doesn’t have an
            umbrella and offers him their Dad’s umbrella, Totoro accepts thankfully. In return he gives them a pouch of
            nuts and seeds. When their Dad’s bus finally arrives Satsuki is really excited to tell her Dad that she saw
            the big Totoro for the first time. The rain is completely forgotten in the excitement.
            <br>
            <br>
            The girls are on a lovely picnic when a telegram comes to tell them that one of their visits to their mother
            is cancelled due to a setback in the recovery. The girls are frightened, they end up getting into and
            argument and Mei storms off in a huff. Mei decides to take a piece of corn she picked earlier that day and
            go to the hospital on foot.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a while people at home notice that Mei is missing. Everyone looks but no one can find her. In
            desperation Satsuki goes to Totoro’s tree and asks him for help. Immediately Totoro summons the catbus and
            guides Satsuki in, the catbus takes her straight to Mei. Satsuki is so relieved that Mei is safe they forget
            their argument completely.
            <br>
            <br>
            The movie ends in a great way, everyone is happy and healthy; during the credits you see Satsuki and Mei’s
            mother, Yasuko Kusakabe, come home and it is all one big happy family again.
