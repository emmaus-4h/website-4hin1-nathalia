           The movie My Neighbour Totoro is about two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move with their Dad to a house in the countryside. Their new neighbour happens to be a spiritual tree guardian, Totoro.
<br>
            <br>
When the family arrive they see their new house for the first time. It looks very rundown and has a neglected feeling around it. But the sisters don’t mind at all, they think that it is the best thing in the world. Satsuki and Mei are super excited to explore the house. When they enter the kitchen they become aware that it is full of small fuzzy black things called dustbunnies (for more info see my characters page)
<br>
            <br>
One day while playing outside Mei spots a pair of white ears in the long grass. These ears belong to a small white Totoro. She follows the Totoro under the house and then in to the forest. Mei ends up at a massive tree in the middle of the forest. This tree is called a camphor tree; it is the home of the large Totoro.
<br> 
            <br>
 Mei tumbles down a hole at the base of the tree and ends up in Totoro’s den. She climbs on top of the big Totoro and falls asleep. When Satsuki gets home from school she asks her Dad where Mei is but he doesn’t know. Satsuki finds Mei’s hat at the edge of the forest, Satsuki goes a little way in to the forest and finds Mei asleep in a clearing. The Totoro is nowhere to be seen.
<br>
            <br>
One day Satsuki and Mei’s Dad had to work late. Satsuki and Mei have just walked home and it is pouring with rain. Their Dad has forgotten to take his umbrella with him to work. Satsuki and Mei decide to walk down to the bus stop with an umbrella to wait for him. While they are waiting the most peculiar thing happens, the big Totoro comes up and stands next to them. Satsuki is amazed, she also realises the Totoro doesn’t have an umbrella and offers him their Dad’s umbrella, Totoro accepts thankfully. In return he gives them a pouch of nuts and seeds. When their Dad’s bus finally arrives Satsuki is really excited to tell her Dad that she saw the big Totoro for the first time. The rain is completely forgotten in the excitement. 
<br>
            <br>
The girls are on a lovely picnic when a telegram comes to tell them that one of their visits to their mother is cancelled due to a setback in the recovery. The girls are frightened, they end up getting into and argument and Mei storms off in a huff. Mei decides to take a piece of corn she picked earlier that day and go to the hospital on foot.
<br>
            <br>
After a while people at home notice that Mei is missing. Everyone looks but no one can find her. In desperation Satsuki goes to Totoro’s tree and asks him for help. Immediately Totoro summons the catbus and guides Satsuki in, the catbus takes her straight to Mei. Satsuki is so relieved that Mei is safe they forget their argument completely.
<br> 
            <br>
The movie ends in a great way, everyone is happy and healthy; during the credits you see Satsuki and Mei’s mother come home and it is all one big happy family again.

    <h3> Satsuki Kusakabe (草壁 サツキ)</h3>
  
  
  </div>
</div>

<div class="left text3 big">
<p> The eldest daughter of the Kusakabe family. She wears a pale yellow sleeveless dress. Miyazaki originally planned for her to be 10-year-old fourth grader, but was changed to a 12-year-old sixth grader.
  <br> 
  <br>
Satsuki is a bright and cheerful individual. She generally tries to be someone to look up to, most likely for her sister. She seems to idolize her mother's peaceful demeanor, and she even says that she wants her hair to cooperate to look like her mother's hair. Satsuki is hard working and intelligent, as shown when she is studying at school or helping out around her new home. She is also very open minded and pleasant towards people like Granny and even Kanta after getting to know his friendly side.
<br>
  <br>
Satsuki Kusakabe seems to be an independent and mature young lady. She does constantly feel grief and pressure, but does not let it show. The grief she feels for her mother being ill is only revealed towards the end of the movie when she breaks down in front of Granny. She also clearly feels very stressed to act like an adult and be a good role model for Mei.
<br>
  <br>
Most of Satsuki's anger stems from Mei's contrasting irresponsibility. She gets easily frustrated, but is still a lovable character with good intentions.
<br> 
  <br>
  Satsuki has short, walnut brown hair and chocolate brown eyes (the eyes mostly appear black due to coloring and art style). She wears a tangerine skirt with tangerine suspenders, white bloomers, a sunshine yellow collared shirt, a sky blue pair of shoes, and a white hat (only worn in the first part of the movie).

    <h3> Mei Kusakabe (草壁メイ)</h3>
  
  
  </div>
</div>

<div class="left text3 big">
<p> The second daughter of the Kusakabe family, only 4-years old.  She has sandy brown hair and chocolate brown eyes. She wears a white puffy blouse with a bright pink dress (as present in her birthday and buyed from a shop) and sunshine yellow shoes and white bloomers, and carries a yellow bag. At the end of the film, she wears a carnation pink dress. <br> <br>
In contrast to her hard-working sister Satsuki, Mei has a stubborn personality and carefree personality. She sometimes quarrel with her older sister, and tends to follow her lead out of loneliness and boredom.  Mei is a bold, happy girl, without any dark shadow sin her personality. She runs after her older sister and imitates her. But if she comes across something interesting she becomes obsessed with it and forgets the way home or time, upsetting her older sister.
  <br><br>
  She doesn't attend kindergarten, and is often left at the care of her grandmother's home. She is naturally curious, which leads her to notice and follow the small-sized Totoros. 
<br>
  <br>
Mei cares deeply of her mother Yasuko who is the nearby hospital for an unspecified illness. She gets into an argument with Satsuki when she finds out their mother wouldn't be returning soon. She takes it upon herself to go to the hospital and ends up getting lost. Only with the efforts of Satsuki, Kanta, Totoro and Catbus do they find her unharmed.
