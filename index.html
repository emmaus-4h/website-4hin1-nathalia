              Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio
              Suzuki, but Miyazaki and Takahata have a relationship that far predates this.
              <br>
              <br>
              The pair first worked together in 1964, marking the beginning of a collaborative relationship that would
              carry on throughout their careers. They had both worked on numerous Japanese movies and television shows
              up until 1984, when Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the first original feature film that Hayao
              Miyazaki directed, became both a box office and critical success.
              <br>
              <br>
              While Nausicaä isn’t an actual Studio Ghibli production, it is unmistakably Miyazaki and displays some of
              the hallmarks that partly define his style. It conveys a strong pro-environmental message and has a
              heroine at the center of the story, both things that he comes back to throughout his future films.
              <br>
              <br>
              Toshio Suzuki was part of the production team on Nausicaä. Buoyed by the film’s performance, Miyazaki and
              Suzuki decided to set up their own studio and invited Takahata to join them. Tokuma-Shoten, the
              Tokyo-based publishing company, provided the necessary funding to found Studio Ghibli, and so a journey
              was started that would result in 21 feature films and a reputation as one of the world’s best animation
              studios. Putting it like this makes it sound like it was a straight line to success, but it wasn’t quite
              that straightforward.
